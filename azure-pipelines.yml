# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
- main  # or the branch you want to trigger on

pool:
  vmImage: 'windows-latest'  # or your preferred agent

steps:
- script: echo 'Hello, World!'
  displayName: 'Run a one-line script'
